This calculator app mimicks the behavior of the calculator app on Mac. It works as follow:

1. Enter a number
2. Select an operation 
3. Enter a second number 
4. Click on equal
5. See the result

It also supports chaining operations, so instead of clicking on "=" to get the result, you can keep performing operations and they will be applied to the latest result.
